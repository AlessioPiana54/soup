Description: The aggregate graph on Memgraph (the legacy
             ClassGraphService.class_process_query of
             Services/AggregateGraph/aggregate_graph_service.py and
             Utils/aggregate_graph_query_lib.py):
             - build_classes(run, entity_types): the properties of the
               events with "nan" or empty values become text (change_nan),
               one :Class node per distinct combination of the chosen
               entity types (create_class_multi_query) with its
               :OBSERVED events, the weight c.Count (set_class_weight) and
               the :DF_C relationships between classes aggregated from :DF
               (class_df_aggregation); returns the times of the phases in
               the keys of the legacy process_info (init/finish_class,
               class_node, obs, dfc);
             - delete_classes(run): MATCH (n:`Class`) DETACH DELETE n,
               then checks that no Class node is left by counting the
               Class nodes (the legacy delete_graph_s of the standard graph
               read the count from a column its queries did not return).
             Every label, type and property goes through ident(); the
             entity types come from the closed list of the graph's types,
             the variables are v0, v1... (the legacy code used the
             lower-cased property names: "Order" and "order" collided, a
             space broke the query); the property names read from the
             graph (change_nan) are quoted too, and one that ident()
             refuses is skipped (the legacy code put it in the text as it
             was, removing only the quotes); :DF_C is aggregated from
             the pattern -[r:`DF`]-> instead of type(r) = 'DF'.
